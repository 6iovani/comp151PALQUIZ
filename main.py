#Problems 1-I cant make it print backwards when I put -1 as the last value in range it doesn't print anything
# tried making appending the numbers in list a list and reversing them, which worked but it looked wierd and the use of lists wasn't in the prompt
for number in range(1,200):
    multiple = 3
    if number%3 == 0:
        print(number)
